# character_prediction
A repository dedicated to LLMs predicting the next character after encountering a sequence of previous characters.

This repository was inspired by [this repository](https://github.com/alexxthiery/char_transformer). Special thanks to [Alexandre Thiery](https://alexxthiery.github.io/) for answering my questions in [this assignment](https://alexxthiery.github.io/teaching/character_LLM/charllm.html).
